# cloudflare-ip-uploader

Because I didn't want to add a bunch of IP addresses to a zone firewall by hand.

## Getting Started

1. Rename `ip_addresses.example.txt` to `ip_addresses.txt`
2. Add IPs to the `ip_addresses.txt` file (one IP per line).
3. Run `EMAIL=email@example.com API_KEY=xxx npm run start` (where `EMAIL` and `KEY` are your Cloudflare email address and API key) to start the script.
4. ???
5. Profit! ðŸ’°

## Requirements

1. Node 11+
